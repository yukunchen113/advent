- made stupid mistake by not putting idx+1 in brackets for pt1 that slowed me down
- spent most of the time trying to understand pt2, actual code change was very small, coming up with solution also didn't take long.
- overall pretty happy with the clean transition of solution.
- need to reconsider adding in process input back in. Reformatting that took an extra couple minutes.
- note: took a nap later in the day + run afterwards, felt more clear headed.
