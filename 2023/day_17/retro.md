- too many smaller mistakes
	- caused by shifting of index of code vs what question asked.
- inefficient code - revisit multiple paths unnecessarily
	- need to practice DP - specifically backtracking
	- the best way forward was actually to heappop the node with min cost
		- this could've been noticed with the `seen and cost > seen[(pos, dir, step)]` line
		- though this will speed it up a bit, a previously seen path could still be bypassed
