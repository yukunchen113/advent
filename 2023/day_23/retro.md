- was quite fast getting the first part
- but for second part, did quite a bunch of rewrites that didn't really change the complexity / inherently leverage the input space
	- should've thought of more solid way to fix problem, and then checked to see how solution would fit
	- I guess, the fear is that I might not be able to leverage the solution as much, but this is an invalid fear
		- first of all, you'll need to solve it anyway and it is safe to assume that patches won't scale.
		- most problems will require the same way of traversal anyway so you can safely assume that functionality can be reused.
- solution was thought of relatively quickly, but the way to execute was lacking.
	- seemed to be very patchy rather than fitting to solution.
	- to much acting on hot takes
- there was a couple of debugging issues which could've been solved if a more detailed look into the samples were considered.
