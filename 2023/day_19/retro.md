Retro
- needed to look at solution for this one
- didn't reuse old solution, (recusive approach) so had to rebalance all assumptions from before
	- this caused me to miss something
- think about full solution - what do you need and alternatives.
	- went with moving from A up, but this caused complicated addition geometry, but could've just split a cube downwards.
